# 118th Congress project

The current (118th) Congress has been called a "do-nothing" Congress.  As of 1 June 2024, 15,366 bills have been introduced but only 64 have become law.  For comparison, the 117th Congress enacted 365 laws.

This project seeks to predict whether a bill introduced in the 118th Congress will become a law.
