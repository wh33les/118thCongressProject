# 118th Congress project

The 118th Congress has been labeled a ''do-nothing'' congress. As of June 1, 2024, 15,366 bills have been introduced, but only 64 have become law. In contrast, the 117th Congress enacted 365 laws. This project aims to predict the likelihood of a bill introduced in the 118th Congress becoming law.
