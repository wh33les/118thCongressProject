# 118th Congress project

This project was completed in approximately 10 days and got me the Data Science Boot Camp certification at Erd&#337;s Institute.

The 118th Congress has been labeled a ''do-nothing'' congress. As of June 1, 2024, 15,366 bills have been introduced, but only 64 have become law. In contrast, the 117th Congress enacted 365 laws. This project aims to predict the whether a bill introduced in the 118th Congress will become law.

I didn't get a chance to apply any NLP techniques to this project.  The `NLPTesting` folder has a small corpus and some experimentation with the `nltk` module.
